## General info

There is a need to identify abnormalities in data so as to predict faults in equipments way before they break down.
This project uses concepts statistics such as mean and variance to build a sliding window that learns from the data and makes 
a prediction of possible faults.

	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python

Dataset is saved in:
* Matlab "mat" file
